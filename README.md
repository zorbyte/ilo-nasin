# ilo nasin

*ilo nasin* is a web application for analyzing, comparing, and creating personal dictionaries for [toki pona](https://tokipona.org). It will be hosted at [nasin.li](https://nasin.li/) once it is in a working state, but is currently **in-development software**.

As toki pona is a philosophical language, *ilo nasin* contains many features dedicated to describing personal use and interpretation of the language, such as:

* marking a word or a definition as *nasin nasa* (experimental use) or *musi taso* (jokes and non-serious use),
* the ability to provide commentary to the entire *nasin*, a word, or a single definition,
* the ability to specify parts of speech of a definition,
* and comparing two *nasin* pages in a special page.
